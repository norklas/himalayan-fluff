# Team Profile Generator

## Description

A **Node.js** CLI for generating a software engineering team page based on user input.

My motivation for this project was to get more familiar with how to use **Jest** for TDD, how to use object classes to create a library, and becoming more proficient with **Inquirer**. I built this project to quickly generate a software engineering team page with the **Node.js** CLI, this would be much quicker than creating the page, CSS, and JavaScript by hand.

I learned how to use the ternary operator more, as well as using **Jest** for TDD. I also became more proficient with creating object constructors, and object classes.

## Installation

To install this, type the following one at a time:

```
npm install, npm i inquirer
